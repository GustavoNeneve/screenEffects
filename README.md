# screenEffects
Inspired by those used in Super Mario Maker 2, I wanted to try create a general package of 'drag and drop' effects able to be used in a variety of Unity games. Everything is done in code, with no handmade animations, and the effects dynamically adjust to the current resolution and aspect ratio. The vast majority of parameters are configurable, and these effects can be called from a globally available script at any time during the game. Feel free to use them how ever you like, under MIT license. I hope it helps somebody!
